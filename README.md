# David's DevOps Adventure

Welcome to my DevOps Adventure! This React-based front-end application serves as the backbone of my DevOps portfolio, showcasing my skills and experience in the world of DevOps. With a sleek and intuitive user interface, this app helps potential employers and collaborators get a better sense of my expertise and achievements.

## Technologies Used

This app is built using JavaScript and React, with a focus on modern, responsive design and seamless user experience. The front-end is containerized using Docker, and can be easily deployed to Azure App Service for seamless integration with the back-end API. Speaking of which...

The back-end API is built using Java and SpringBoot, providing a robust and scalable foundation for my DevOps portfolio. The API is also containerized using Docker and can be deployed alongside the front-end in Azure App Service for maximum performance and efficiency.

Finally, the database is powered by MongoDB running on Azure Cosmos DB, ensuring reliable and secure data storage for my portfolio.
