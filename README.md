# David's DevOps Adventure

Welcome to my DevOps Adventure! This React-based front-end application serves as the backbone of my DevOps portfolio, showcasing my skills and experience in the world of DevOps. With a sleek and intuitive user interface, this app helps potential employers and collaborators get a better sense of my expertise and achievements.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and efficient development experience.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for a modern and responsive user interface.
- [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for a fast and low-level JavaScript optimization.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization and easy deployment to Azure App Service.

### Front-End App

The front-end app, built with React and JavaScript, delivers a modern, responsive design and seamless user experience by dynamically feeding content from MongoDB on Azure Cosmos DB via the back-end API built with Java and SpringBoot.
